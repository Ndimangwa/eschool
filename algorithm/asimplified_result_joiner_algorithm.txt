Algorithm: Results Calculation Within a Group 
1. Results within a ResultsGroup is calculated under the following 
	1.1 The results Group is manually closed, automatically it will close all the contained results 
	1.2 There is a change in Accademic Year, all previous years Results Groups will be closed 
	
	[
	Individual Results can be Opened or Closed  [If the hosting ResultsGroup is still Open]
	If ResultsGroup is closed, any contained Results will be closed.
	If ResultsGroup is opened, the contained Results will not be opened 
	]
	Note : Any scenario which will cause the Results Group to be closed, results within a Group will be calculated and finalized 
	
//Note the results are in a sorted order
Algorithm by Example 
//Primary Object, Results1 ==> ResultsFile
//GroupResultsCalculator 
	--> groupResultsFile1 = With no file and do necessary initialization
	--> Data Structure is array of Results and ResultsFile of an object 
		ie ds1[i][0] = Results 
		   ds1[i][1] = ResultsFile 
		   ds1[i][2] = Pointer // Will be used in calculate  Algorithm, initialize at 0
	--> Get ResultsAMergedResults Header 
	--> Using a ResultsMergedHeader, merge results two by two , meaning 
		$mergedResultsFile = resultsFile[0] //Results0 should be primary
		for (i=1; i < sizeof(ds1); i++)	{
			if (primary Proceed) {
				$mergedResultsFile = merge($mergedResultsFile, resultsFile[i]) //Weight do not forget , Results is 100based/denominator is 100
			} else if (supplimentary)	{
				mark supplimentary Index //Only one supplimentary is accepted
			}
		}
		Now my results are in mergedResultsFile
		You Need to mergeWithCorrection(mergedResultsFile, supplimentaryResultsFile) //I think after grading is when you will know pass or failed
		
		filename results_group_[groupId].csv 
		gradedfilename results_group_[groupId].csv.graded
