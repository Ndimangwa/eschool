[] If Briefcase is Locked show results and graded to student  
[] if Group is Locked show the combined results [] at this time show also the individual results , student needs to know how the individual results were calculate 
[][] The Briefcase Results [whether briefcase or its group] should be shown only if there exists no results for the examination linked to the group 


http://halotel.co.tz/loginfail.html <-- Write to Halotel check tanzania spelling , t should be capitalized

You need to modify the existing ApprovalSequenceSchema to handle results too ,
my idea for today, in the schema we can add the specialOperation in the schema , specialOperation can further explain the operationCode
Example 
	specialOperation can be CAT.EXAM.UPLOAD 
							UE.EXAM.UPLOAD,
							Note: Though both case the OperationCode will be EXAMINATION_UPLOAD, however the specialInstruction will give further details 
								If the specialInstruction is null [default], just move as we used to, but if it is not empty then schema should be returned which matches the operationCode and specialInstruction

	"21" => "Upload Examination"
)
dbSchemaSpecialInstruction = array()	{
	"21" => array()	{
		"1" => "Continuous Examination",    [You can save this as 21.1]
		"2" => "University Examination"		[You can save this as 21.2] .. since no conflict of these numbers
	}
