Required to find Today:
Step 1: Let us give days numbers [You can change the numbering System]
	0 => Sunday
	1 => Monday
	2 => Tuesday
	3 => Wednesday
	4 => Thursday
	5 => Friday
	6 => Saturday

Step 2: "If Yesterday was Tomorrow",
	Let find what is really tomorrow
	tomorrow = today + 1 [One day after today]
	
	Then, if.yesterday was tomorrow becomes
	"if.yesterday" = today + 1 [The problem assumes yesterday were tomorrow, so assumed yesterday becomes now our actual tomorrow]

Step 3: "Today would have been Saturday"
	note : from step 2, "if.yesterday" = today + 1 [assumed yesterday]
	then "if.today" = "if.yesterday" + 1 [Assumed today, a day after assumed yesterday]
	so "if.today" = (today + 1) + 1 OR today + 2
	But we know "if.today" = Saturday which is 6 [from step 1]
	so "if.today" = 6 (Saturday) = today + 2
	We get : today + 2 = 6
	today = 6 -2
	today  = 4
	From step 1, 4 represents Thursday 
We conclude the teacher made that statement on THURSDAY
